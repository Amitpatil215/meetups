# Informal Meetup (07 Jan 2020)

## Minutes of Meetup : 
- Only 2 folks from attended the meetup today
- They are going well as of now.
- They just had a confusion that they are currently working on small features which won't make much difference. However we cleared there doubts. As well as asked them explore other fields if they are losing their interests in their current field.
- As a feedback they asked us to conduct more meetups on topics they are lagging behind like apis etc. As well as devsprints and hacknights.
