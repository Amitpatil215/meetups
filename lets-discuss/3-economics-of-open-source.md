Economics of Open Source
10th July, 2021

Introductory Question:
    > About Yourself
    > Any other interesting thing you working on


A good talk to watch on this topic: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO8hZlgK5zc

### How individuals can earn from their open source projects:

#### Contributing and getting donations and sponsors

(https://sindresorhus.com/thanks is probably the best example)

    Sometimes sponsors/donors may ask you to prioritize features, but you're not legally bound to that commitment, and only work on it based on your goodwill.


Is it sustainable/reliable?
    > We all felt that it is not a very feasible and reliable source of income initially.
    You can start a project(s) as a hobby and transition into earning through funding and sponsors once you are big enough.
    Can metaphor to content creation.

Work on some open-source projects as an employee of some corporate then?
    > You'll be legally bound, and not all might like the corporate culture.


Vue, Curl are some good examples of projects that got big and converted into a company.

#### As a full time employee

Get paychecks to work on open source projects

#### Open Source Companies and worker cooperatives (https://github.com/hng/tech-coops)

(There's a difference between being an employee in propieretary shit vs in open source)


### How companies earn money off their open source project
    - Freemium model: The basic and barebone features are freely available but other premium features are paid (for convenience). eg. bitwarden
    - Crowdsourcing and donations: Companies earning from donations and funding (from bigger orgs). eg. babel
    - SaaS (Software as a Service) model: you sell your software for others to use by paying. eg. hosting services like deno deploy

Other models: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_models_for_open-source_software

// Onivim has a unique model (https://github.com/onivim/oni2#time-delay-dual-license)
