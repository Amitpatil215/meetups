# Let's Discuss
## Decentralisation
### 31st July, 2021


### Cons of centralisation:

- npm: totally centralized the entire js ecosystem, can sell data to companies funding it

- if decentralised, server load is reduced, no one point of failure since decentralization has multiple nodes

- lack of redundancy, so all control to one org

- cannot trust them, they can change anything upstream, and they're not accountable


### difference b/w decentralized and distributed and centralized: 

- Imp observation: **think of it by authority, if there's one authority that has control, can be called centralized (despite having multiple servers distributed around), but if there are multiple authorities having control, can be called distributed**

- **A decentralized system is a subset of a distributed system.**


- for distributed, each node should have info about other nodes
- for decentralized, decision making is divided among nodes, and each node doesn't necessarily need info of other nodes


```
examples of distributed: IPFS/torrents (anyone can set up tracking servers, shows how much control everyone has)
example of decentralised: mastodon, blockchain
```

### Some other points discussed:

- con of distributed: to add new things, a lot of people need to be part of the decision, but in centralized, the process can be faster(?)

- distributed: accessibility is more

- authority is being split up (decentralised): single entity doesn't have control over data so they cannot destroy it whenever they want, so they can't misuse it, no single point of failure, 

- deno: can install packages from anywhere using url, no central package registry needed

- people have the freedom to start their own registries (like npm), but the entire ecosystem has become so reliant on npm that they probably won't switch to any other registry
